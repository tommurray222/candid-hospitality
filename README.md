# candid-hospitality
Collection of python code used during my data internship at Candid Hospitality, an anonymous matchmaking service for hospitality careers.

**candid_cleaning** is a collection of functions used to correct errors in the data, and fix any formatting issues the data has when importing.

**candid_data** is a script that applies the candid_cleaning functions in order, and merges the 3 datasets: matches, users, and chats
